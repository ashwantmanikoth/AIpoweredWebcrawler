# IntelliSearch using Crawler and RAG
**IntelliSearch web crawler** is an intelligent web crawler that leverages advanced AI language models (LLMs) along with modern search techniques to deliver precise, context-aware answers. The system employs dense vector retrieval (via Qdrant) and RAG Fusion for re-ranking, and itâ€™s designed to be easily extended with advanced techniques such as Late Interaction and token-level refinement.

## Features

- **Hybrid LLM Integration:**
  - **Local LLMs:** Run directly on your machine for enhanced data privacy and control.
  - **Paid API LLMs:** Utilize cutting-edge models like OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 for superior performance and real-time capabilities.

- **Efficient Vector Search with Qdrant:**
  - **Search results:** SerpAPI free use tier for Google search results 
  - **Fast & Accurate:** Qdrant efficiently stores and retrieves dense embeddings to ensure quick and precise search results at scale.

- **Advanced Retrieval Techniques:**
  - **RAG Fusion Reranking:** Merges multiple search results using reciprocal rank fusion to prioritize the most relevant documents.
  - **Planned Enhancements:** Integrate Late Interaction techniques (e.g., ColBERT-style token-level re-ranking) and hybrid search methods (combining dense embeddings with BM25).

- **Enterprise-Ready:**
  - **Customizable for Closed Systems:** Easily tunable for internal databases and proprietary search systems, similar to industry-leading apps similar to Perplexity.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - **Gradio UI:** A simple, interactive web-based interface for seamless user interactions.

##  How It Works
-  **Document Loading & Processing**
    -  The system fetches documents via the search service and splits them into manageable chunks.
  
-  **Vector Storage & Retrieval**
    -  Chunks are embedded using a dense embedding model and stored in Qdrant. Retrieval is performed using dense vector search.

-  **RAG Fusion Re-ranking**
    -  Multiple search queries are generated, and results are merged using reciprocal rank fusion or Unique union for broader search use-cases to prioritize accurate matching.

-  **Answer Synthesis**
    -  The retrieved context is fed into an LLM (local or API-based) to generate a final answer in markdown format with links to sources.
